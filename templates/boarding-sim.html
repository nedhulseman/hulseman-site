  <h1><strong> Data Science without Data? Computer Simulation with Flight Boarding
    Strategies</strong><br></h1>
  <p class="author">August 19, 2018  /  Ned Hulseman</p>

    <strong>Why No Data?</strong><br>
      For airlines, efficiency is everything when getting passengers on and off the
      plane. When the plane is on the ground they are not making money, which means
      they are losing money because of costs. It is very important to get the planes
      ready to go and back in the air as quickly as possible. One of the difficulties
      of getting planes back in the air is getting passengers on and off the plane
      in a timely manner.
      <br><br>
      Airlines use many different methods of boarding. Many use zones and board either
      back to front or front to back. It is most common to see 4-5 zones, dependent
      on the size of the flight, but this is something they can tweak for efficiency.
      This is generally the old-school way of doing things. Southwest is
      interesting in that they have everyone just pick seats. This essentially serves
      as boarding in random order, with the exception of tendencies of humans to prefer
      certain seats (ie windows or aisles, or just anything but the middle!) or to
      prefer sitting as a family or with a group.
      <br><br>
      To find the most efficient boarding technique a data scientist would typically say,
      "OKAY airlines, give me a bunch of data on your methods and boarding times, and
      I will find the most efficient boarding method." The airline responds and says,
      "well we would have to put in a lot of infrastructure in our processes to collect
      this data, we have to give the airline personnel a way of recording the boarding
      times, and that introduces costs, as well as opportunities for bias if the
      personnel messes up the records." Basically the airline says its too expensive
      and they feel better just winging the boarding process.
      <br><br>
      Well, maybe there is a less costly method of solving the problem. The
      computer-scientist part of the data scientist, might realize they could solve
      this problem without data and just create a boarding simulator. This would
      cost the airline no money and decrease the chance for unreliable data.
      <br><br><br>
      <strong>Passenger Rules</strong><br>
      I wrote a program where you can choose the boarding method, number of zones and
      number of rows/aisles on the plane and it will run through a simulation a number
      of times.
      <br><br>
      To start off, we can go over some of the rules that I gave the boarding passengers
      to make this simulation as realistic as possible, and I will also propose some
      ideas that could be implemented to give this simulation an even more realistic
      flow.
      <br><br>
      Each passenger goes through around an 11 step decision process to decide what to
      do or where to move. This decision process is based largely on where the passenger
      is, as well as what the person in front of them is doing. A passenger will never
      get within a certain distance of the person in front of them, given that the
      person is not seated. This certain distance is what I refer to in the code as
      a 'personal_bubble'.

      <br><br>
      Once a passenger reaches their assigned row, then the passenger will pause fo
      r an allotted amount of time simulating a passenger placing their baggage in
      the overhead compartment. I decided to make this time over exaggerated, so
      that we can see large differences between the different methods. Storing
      luggage and getting seated is the main cause of delay when boarding a plane.
      <br><br>
      For actual implementation of this simulation for an airline, the programmer
      would want to use scaled dimensions of the plane and jet tunnel, as well as
      accurate speeds/times that it takes for a passenger to walk through the
      the tunnel and plane. They could then speed up the simulation from there.
      Our simulation times are not accurate enough to scale to actual boarding
      times, we are just concerned with the differences in boarding times
      between the methods.

      When running this simulation, I use graphics to visualize what is actually
      happening (seen above).
      This representation is not necessary to solve the problem but can give your
      audience a much better
      look at what is happening. The code for this simulation can be found on

      <strong>Boarding Methods</strong><br>
      I have added 3 main boarding methods as well as other parameters someone can
       choose within those methods. The 3 methods are:
      <ol>
      	<li>Random Seat Assignment / Unassigned Seats</li>
      	<li>Front to Back</li>
      	<li>Back to Front</li>
      </ol>
      Within those methods you can also choose the number of zones (NA for random seat
      assignment), number of aisles and number of rows.
      <br><br><br>
      <strong>Results</strong><br>
      After watching the 3 boarding methods simulate a few times, I noticed that the
      back to front and front to back usually had roughly 2-3 people storing their
      luggage and sitting down at a single point in time. The random seating method
      usually has 3-5 people storing their luggage. I believe that this is why the
      random method is the fastest boarding method, as we will find out below.

      After running 150 simulations (50 for each method), which took roughly 3 hours,
      I found that the random boarding method is the most consistent and quickest
      method of the
      <figure class="image-right" style="width: 432;">

      three boarding methods. For the simulations, I used 28 rows, 6 aisles and 4
      boarding zones. This isÂ  representative of a midsize Boeing 737 passenger
      airplane.

      The results of the 150 simulations can be seen in the graphic to the right,
      which was created using the Matplotlib module. The blue which represents the
      random boarding method, is the fastest and most consistent while the front
      to back method is the slowest and most inconsistent. The seconds measurement
      does not scale to any real-time boarding time. The idea is really to try
      and see if we can find differences in the boarding times of the different
      methods. We see that the orange distribution, which represents the back to
      front method is very consistent but slightly slower than the random method.
